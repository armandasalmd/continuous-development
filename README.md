#### Introduction
Most of the young developers get stuck at learning rapidly changing technologies. There are to many things in programming world to learn, but how to learn it efficiency? For instance, if I want to learn React, first I must to know javascript, html, css etc. As a result, a learning of React becomes ineffective as you don't have fundamental skills. The answer is PLANNING.

This project will cover an approach to continuously improvement as a developer by splitting the tasks into managable parts similar to some of the Scrum techniques like Story-Mapping, prioritization etc.

Let's begin!

#### 1. Finding what you want to learn - mind map it
It's important to understand what you want to learn and set a goal. There are su many things that we usually focus to much on one of them. To have an image of what we want to learn, the best practise is to take a peace of paper and write everything down (mind-map it). This is important for the next step of planning a detailed learning schema. You might use arrows to connect related things together.

#### 2. Creating *CDP* - topics tree view
Now we need to create a full map of the things we want to learn. We are going to use the scrap paper of ideas we have just created. Start from root element i.e. "Programming" and make nestings. It's is a good practise to nest into small manageable parts. Usually the last element can be learned from a couple of articles within a period of 3 days.

To achieve this, I suggest using https://draw.io website for drawing diagrams. Call the tree-view diagram `cdp.drawio`

#### 3. Searching for useful resources - *resource backlog*
Knowledge doesn't come from nowhere. That's why it is important to prepare the resources we are going to use for learning. The list of resources might change overtime time, that's why we call it *backlog*. To most convenient way to track the resources would be using EXCEL sheet. An example Resourse Backlog can be found in the files. 

The resources might be:
- Books
- Videos
	- Youtube
	- LinkedIn learning
- Documentation websites
- Online learning websites like W3School, TutorialsPoint etc.
- Blog websites like medium.com

#### 4. Prioritizing the topics
Some of the topics are more important than other or even necessarily to continue with some others. For instance, to learn Django first I have to learn Python. Thats why tree-view is advantageous. When we take a look at a node `Django` we must ensure that its children are completed. Without out it, it's simply inefficient to start `Django` itself. Thats why I suggest using colloring to emphasize higher level elements compared to lower ones. Use color intensity to identify that (Root elements might be strong green going down to a light green or white).

#### 5. Making a learning queue
This is useful if you want to learn in a time framed environment. Give a tree-view elements and ID and use excel to write out the learning queue including deadline specifications.

#### 6. Learning technique
After the planning stage is done we must follow some sort of learning logic. For each element iterate these steps:
- Read gathered resources
- Take notes using MD
- *Optional* take online tests
- Create some exercises (definitions) that uses the skill
- Experiment yourself by writing a small program to solve those exercises

#### 7. Defining the *Definition of Done (DoD)*
To make sure that we have learned the skill we need to define rules that must be met to be done. Everyone might create a different DoD, but the example can be:
- Notes have been taken
- *Optional* Online tests/exercises passesed
- Small program has been written

Once DoD has been met, you can cross out the node from the CPD diagram/schema and go upwards.
