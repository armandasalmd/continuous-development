## Project specifications

You can find website "expert" that say it's not important to have specifications, but you'll not find a business working without one.

-   specifications are agreed by all involved
-   changes may be negotiated

Mostly consist of:

1. _Standard specs_ common to all projects
1. Specific details for the project

#### Document structure

-   **Item 1 - cover sheet**
    Includes 'project name', 'version', 'author', 'data', 'contributing team'
-   Item 2 - overview
    It provides the outline of the overall subject, pointers to other relevant DOCS or projects
-   **Item 3 - project requirements**
    Outline: purpose, goal, limitations
-   **Item 4 - assumptions (requirements)**
    Minimum hardware specification; Knowledge needed
-   **Item 5 - out of scope**
    -   list the limitations; ensure what won't be delivered as well
-   Item 6 - questions
    list questions about the things you don't know
-   **Item 7 - project management approach** - how it'll be managed? tracked? tested? - how it'll catch up if it falls behind? - extend delivery date - additional resources (staff) - partial delivery
-   Item 8 - security & data protection (not always applicable) - what data has to be protected? - how it'll be protected? - how it'll be recovered after system crash? - where it'll be stored?
-   Item 9 - final test and acceptance - how it'll be tested? - stress test - try and make it fail to find the maximum - can we make it wrong?
-   Item 10 - support and updates - do we need future support (post release), bug fixes, system updates - intellectual property - who owns what parts of the source code and ideas

In this module we need items: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 (template)

#### SMART framework

1. Specific
   described in depth. Not like 'it will be fast', but instead 'it will run in 10 sec and will be clustered'
1. Measurable
   specific targets has to be measurable. you must state how it will be measured. this is the evidene that you achieved the custom requirement
1. Achievable
   should be able to describe why your project target is achievable (by previous experience || pilot study results)
1. Relevant
   targets must be relevant to the project
1. Time-based
   discuss a possible delivery date, always do planning
